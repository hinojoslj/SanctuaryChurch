## Building

### Importing Songs

Always check if a song is in the library first.
If you don't know if the song you need has been imported, follow the steps for [Existing Song](/README.md#existing-song) first, then if not found then follow [New Song](/README.md#new-song).

---

#### Existing Song:

Quick steps: ctrl+f -> select library -> type song name

:warning: Songs may be imported multiple times depending if it is a worship song or an altar song. :warning:

Worship Song - To be broadcasted to online services, so it has lower-thirds themes applied.

Altar Song - NOT to be broadcasted to online services. No lower-thirds themes applied.

---

#### New Song:

If not in the library, then ctrl+f, switch to SongSelect, and type the song name. Click on any of the results to preview the lyrics of the song. Once you find the song you'd like, click the import button at the bottom.

For a more detailed walkthrough, [read this documentation](https://learn.renewedvision.com/propresenter/working-with-files#import-songselect).

When you import, the template theme needs to be applied.
Below are the settings, we follow at the time of writing (11/2022):

(TODO -- VERIFY)

- Slides delimited by: **_Line Break_**
- Delimiters per slide: **_1_**
- Size: **_UPDATE ME_**
- Template: **_UPDATE ME_**
- Library: **_UPDATE ME_**
- Playlist: Whichever playlist you are currently building for, usually Sunday for Sunday church service.

### Sermons

The best way to build a sermon is to build off an existing sermon. Below is the guide to how to build quickly, followed by an explanation of how the builds work, such as which themes and audience looks are used. Building from scratch is not recommended unless you really know what you are doing as this could introduce errors and cause the build to not work for online services. (And not explained for this reason.)

#### Quick Build Guide

The best way to build sermons is to build using an existing sermon.

> TIP: Try to find a sermon that has the type of items you need. For example, if your sermon needs quotes, and main title points, find a sermon with all those items. It allows you to use quick-edit to modify the text, instead of building a quote slide from scratch.

Make sure you are in presentations library, then find a sermon to use as a template. `Right-click` the sermon file, `click` duplicate, or copy, then paste. `Right-click` the duplicate sermon and `click` rename to the new sermon title with date.

Delete all previous bible verses.

> New Sermon Series? Then you probably need to replace the background images. [Go here to read how to replace the images.](/README.md#replacing-the-background-images)

Quotes? `Right-click` and `click` quick edit. Replace the text with the new quote.

Title Points? `Right-click` and `click` quick edit. Replace the text with the new title point.

Import Verses? Click the Bible icon in the Toolbar, or `ctrl+b`. Type the verse(s) needed, verify the bible version. Make sure the correct bible theme is selected. In the bottom-left, `click` Save As... -> Copy to selected presentation. (Saves it to the sermon presentation you have selected.)

> If you do not see the theme you need, you may need to update the theme. Don't know how to do that? [Follow the step-by-step here](/README.md#replacing-the-background-images).

---

#### Replacing the background images

Make sure to have the necessary images downloaded and open them in finder. Also, make sure you have the sermon presentation open in ProPresenter. Next, drag and drop the image into the appropiate slide.

> TIP: How do you drag and drop? Press and hold the mouse while you drag the file to the propresenter window and release once you are on top of the slide you would like to replace the image of.

For example, if it is the sermon title slide, drag and drop the new sermon title image into all the sermon title slides.

> TIP: After the first drag, you may get a prompt telling you this image already exists, would you like use existing or replace the image? Click Use Existing, but it doesn't really matter.

#### Updating Themes

The primary reason we update the themes is for bible verses, or for guest speakers.
